When creating the weights to be trained, a proper selection might increase the accuracy of the models or avoid barren plateaus. \

Investigate \ac{qml} model training with different optimizers, maybe even no gradient-based methods. \

Investigate the influence of the different loss functions when training a \ac{qml} model. How to interpret correctly the measurements at the end of the \ac{qml} model, can it be assumed to be a probability distribution? \

Do experiments with new ansätze, maybe quantum kernels. \

Do experiments with new encoding mechanisms, angle, etc. (encoding might have a big influence in how the features are interpreted) \

Perform other different attacks like carlini and wagner \

Perform transfer attacks between noisy models including the noiseless models. Basically create adversarial examples from noisy models and see how effective they are against other noisy models or the noiseless model. \

% Take noise out of the evaluation part of the training (i think currently the noisy model is used to calculate the accuracy of the model during training) \
