Do experiments with new ans√§tze, maybe quantum kernels.

Do experiments with new encoding mechanisms, angle, etc. (encoding might have a big influence in how the features are interpreted)

Take noise out of the evaluation part of the training (i think currently the noisy model is used to calculate the accuracy of the model during training)
