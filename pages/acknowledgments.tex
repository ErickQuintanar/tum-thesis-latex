I want to thank first my supervisors Kilian Tscharke and Pascal Debus,
without their guidance and help this thesis would not have been possible. \
I also want to thank my friends and family for their unconditional
love and support. Fatma, María, Rubén, Joanna, Chuy and Oscar, I hope one
day I will be able to repay you everything you have given me. Additionally,
I want to thank Nicola Franco and David Winderl for sharing their expertise
on quantum machine learning. Last but not least, I want to thank Prof. Dr.
Claudia Eckert for the giving me the opportunity to work on this thesis
in a very new and exciting field.
