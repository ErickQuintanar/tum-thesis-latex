\section{Section} \

1.	Explain why decoherent noise is used and not coherent. \

  a. Coherent noise will probably just shift the bias. \

  b. Coherent noise might add too much noise (quadratic growth). \

  c. True random noise is required to improve generalization. \

% TODO: Do an experiment implementing coherent noise to prove this claim.
% Use https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_variational_classifier/ - circuit-centric quantum classifier ansatz

\section{Variational Quantum Algorithm Model Training}\label{section:vqa_training} \

Introduce reproduction of variational circuits inspired by circuit centric ansatz. \

\section{Adversarial Attacks on Variational Quantum Algorithm Model}\label{section:vqa_attacks} \

Mention cleverhans library and how it is used. Mention pipeline to create the adversarial samples. Mention the attack strenght ratio, take into account that the samples are being produced over preprocessed data.

\section{Experiments}\label{section:experiments} \

Possible experiments: \

a. Change the type of encoding \

b. Variational quantum circuits and kernels \

 1. Amplitude damping (open quantum systems / how the quantum system is affected by its environment) \

 2. Phase damping (loss of information but not energy) \

 3. Simpler phase and bit flips \
