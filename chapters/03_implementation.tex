\section{Section}
a.	Introduce the used datasets and why they were chosen.
b.	Describe how the experiments have been chosen and created:
    i.	Possible mixes with different types of noise, in different places, with different datasets and QML mechanisms.


Possible experiments: \

a. Change the type of encoding \

b. Variational quantum circuits and kernels \

 1. Amplitude damping (open quantum systems / how the quantum system is affected by its environment) \

 2. Phase damping (loss of information but not energy) \

 3. Simpler phase and bit flips \
