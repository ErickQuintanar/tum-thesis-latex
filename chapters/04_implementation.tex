\section{Section} \

1.	Explain why decoherent noise is used and not coherent. \

  a. Coherent noise will probably just shift the bias. \

  b. Coherent noise might add too much noise (quadratic growth). \

  c. True random noise is required to improve generalization. \

% TODO: Do an experiment implementing coherent noise to prove this claim.
% Use https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_variational_classifier/ - circuit-centric quantum classifier ansatz

\section{Experiments}

Possible experiments: \

a. Change the type of encoding \

b. Variational quantum circuits and kernels \

 1. Amplitude damping (open quantum systems / how the quantum system is affected by its environment) \

 2. Phase damping (loss of information but not energy) \

 3. Simpler phase and bit flips \

 \subsection{Variational Quantum Classifiers Training}\label{subsection:vqc_training} \

 Introduce reproduction of variational circuits inspired by circuit centric ansatz. \

% TODO: State the result of training QVC with regards to the chosen datasets.
% TODO: Compare to paper adn state why they might be valid results.
