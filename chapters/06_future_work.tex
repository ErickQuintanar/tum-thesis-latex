When creating the weights to be trained, a proper selection might increase the accuracy of the models or avoid barren plateaus. \

Investigate \ac{qml} model training with different optimizers, maybe even no gradient-based methods. \

Investigate the influence of the different loss functions when training a \ac{qml} model. How to interpret correctly the measurements at the end of the \ac{qm} model, can it be assumed to be a probability distribution? \

Do experiments with new ans√§tze, maybe quantum kernels. \

Do experiments with new encoding mechanisms, angle, etc. (encoding might have a big influence in how the features are interpreted) \

Take noise out of the evaluation part of the training (i think currently the noisy model is used to calculate the accuracy of the model during training) \
